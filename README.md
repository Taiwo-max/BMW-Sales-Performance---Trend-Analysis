# BMW Global Revenue Analysis Dashboard (2010–2024)

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive revenue analysis dashboard built using historical BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024. The dashboard provides insights into long-term revenue trends, top-performing vehicle models, and regional revenue distribution to support strategic, data-driven decision-making.

The project was completed as a team-based analytics assignment, with each team member responsible for specific analytical components. My primary focus was on the revenue analysis, including trend identification, KPI development, and visualization design related to revenue performance.
